Put another way, for a fixed primal point $x$, we can evaluate $v \\maspto \\partial f(x) \\cdot v$ for about the same cost as evaluating $f$.\n",

If we apply a JVP to a one-hot tangent vector, it reveals one column of the Jacobian matrix, corresponding to the nonzero entry we fed in. So we can build a full Jacobian one column at a time, and to get each column costs about the same as one function evaluation. That will be efficient for functions with \"tall\" Jacobians, but inefficient for \"wide\" Jacobians.\n",

Building that matrix one column at a time, with each call taking a similar number of FLOPs to evaluating the original function, sure seems inefficient! In particular, for training neural networks, where $f$ is a training loss function and $n$ can be in the millions or billions, this approach just won't scale.\n",
